### Style and colours
![colour-palette](documentation/colour-palette.png)
After creating the wireframes and main structure of the home page, I needed some inspiration for the style and colour. I sourced an [image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/pile-of-assorted-photos-191429/) that I could use as the background image for the home page. Then I headed to [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) and use the "create palette from photo" function. I uploaded the image and played around to find a palette I liked.

## Testing

### Found bugs

- #### Connecting Django to AWS

  I deployed the app on Heroku but without the static files. I created a S3 Bucket on AWS to store the static files and linked that to my app. After linking AWS to my app and trying to redeploy on Heroku I was getting the following error:

  ` botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the PutObject operation: Access Denied
  Error while running '$ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput'. `

  To resolve the issue I have taken the following steps:
    - I checked that the bucket policy had public access.
    - I checked the bucket policy code written in JSON for syntax mistakes.
    - I checked that the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key from where correctly added on Heroku's Config Vars.
  
  When checking the AWS Access Key ID I noticed that there was a '/' in it which can be problematic. I tried generating a new Access Key ID from AWS and updating it on Heroku's Config Vars which solved the issue.
